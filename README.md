This repository contains a **multi-tier application setup** using Docker.  
It is designed to demonstrate containerized deployment of a backend service with a proxy layer.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (if using multi-container setup)

### Build & Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   cd <your-repo>
````

2. Build the backend service:

   ```bash
   docker build -t my-backend ./backend
   ```

3. Build the proxy service:

   ```bash
   docker build -t my-proxy ./proxy
   ```

4. Run the containers:

   ```bash
   docker network create mynetwork
   docker run -d --name backend --network mynetwork my-backend
   docker run -d --name proxy --network mynetwork -p 80:80 my-proxy
   ```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

* **Database credentials**: Stored in `db-password.txt` (⚠️ recommend using environment variables or Docker secrets instead of committing plaintext passwords).
* **Proxy config**: Found inside `proxy/` (e.g., `nginx.conf`).

---

## 📖 Documentation

* [Dockermultiterapp.docx](./Dockermultiterapp.docx) – Contains detailed explanation of the architecture and setup.

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

* Remove sensitive files (`db-password.txt`) from the repo or replace with environment variables.
* Use `.gitignore` to avoid committing secrets in the future.
